# Overview

This is a follow-along of `cstack`'s "Build your own SQLite" tutorial [here](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/). 

Files named `part{n}.c` are the code snippets found at the end of each section. To view diffs:

```
# In vim, with `part{n+1}.c` open:
:vert diffsplit part{n}.c

# In the terminal
vimdiff part{n}.c part{n+1}.c
```
